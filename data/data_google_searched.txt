India is the second most populous country in the world, with over 1.277 billion people (2015), more than a sixth of the world's population. Already containing 17.5% of the world's population, India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2022, surpassing China, its population reaching 1.6 billion by 2050.[5][6] Its population growth rate is 1.2%, ranking 94th in the world in 2013.[7] The Indian population had reached the billion mark by 1998.

India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio should be just over 0.4.[8]

India has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[9] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates (the Nihali language[10] spoken in parts of Maharashtra and the Burushaski language spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir).

Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn 1][fn 2] The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[26] The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.[27]

Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago,[28] with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.[29] The country's constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.

Driven by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.[30] This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent.[30] During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.[31][32] By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[33] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[34] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[35]

The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity.[36] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.[37] Accounting for 34% of global military spending[38] and 23% of world GDP,[39] it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.[40]

Australia is one of the world's leading destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). The country's robust economy, strategic location, strong global trade and investment ties, and proven track record of innovation position Australia as an ideal investment destination; ranking amongst the top destinations in the world.

Companies from around the world have made the decision to invest in Australia and benefit from a sophisticated infrastructure, skilled workforce, political stability, and continued strong economic performance. Of course Australia's geographical position also makes it an ideal platform in to Asia, whilst time zones cross-over to both Europe and the Americas, making it an ideal location for global business interactions.

Level of foreign investment in Australia

Total FDI stock growing 6.6 per cent to reach a record AU$507 billion in 2011. This growth reflected the upturn in global FDI activity since 2010 and Australia's strong competitive position in the global economy. Although in 2012 it recorded a slight decline, inward FDI flows into Australia more than doubled over the five years to 2012, outpacing global growth, as per latest annual data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The total stock of foreign investment in Australia was $2.5 trillion in 2013 (up 11.3 per cent from 2012), and Australian investment abroad totalled $1.6 trillion.

In 2013 alone, foreign investors injected $115 billion of direct investment into Australia, that is, investment into business in which a foreign investor had some element of control, by owning 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power. The largest sources of this direct investment were the United States ($35 billion), Singapore ($14 billion), the United Kingdom ($12 billion) and Japan ($10 billion). This provides a vital supplement to domestic savings needed to fund the country's total investment requirements. Other major source countries for investment include China and Hong Kong, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Australia was ranked the 14th largest destination country for world direct investment in 2013 and the 18th largest source country for world direct investment.

Brazil is the 22nd largest export economy in the world and the 56th most complex economy according to the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). In 2013, Brazil exported $247B and imported $238B, resulting in a positive trade balance of $9.2B. In 2013 the GDP of Brazil was $2.25T and its GDP per capita was $15k.

The electricity sector in Canada has played a significant role in the economic and political life of the country since the late 19th century. The sector is organized along provincial and territorial lines. In a majority of provinces, large government-owned integrated public utilities play a leading role in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Ontario and Alberta have created electricity markets in the last decade in order to increase investment and competition in this sector of the economy.[1]

Canada is the world's second-largest producer of hydroelectricity after China,[2] which accounted for 58% of all electric generation in 2007.[3][4] Since 1960, large hydroelectric projects, especially in Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador, have significantly increased the country's generation capacity. Canada is the world's sixth-largest producer of electricity generated by nuclear power, producing 97 billion kWh in 2013.[5] In Ontario, Canadian-designed CANDU nuclear reactors supplied more than half the provincial electricity demand in 2007.[4] In April 2014, Ontario became the first jurisdiction in North America to fully eliminate coal as a source of electricity generation.[6][7]

Canadian homes, offices and factories are large users of electricity, or hydro, as it is often called in Canada.[8] In 2007, Canadian per capita power consumption was among the highest in the world, with an average of 16,995 kWh per annum.[9]

Russia has a high-income[24] mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Market reforms in the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions in the energy and defense-related sectors.

Russia relies on energy revenues to drive growth. Containing over 30 percent of the world's natural resources,[25] which are estimated to be worth $75.7 trillion, Russia is the most resource-rich country in the world.[26] Russia has an abundance of oil, natural gas and precious metals, which make up a major share of Russia's exports. As of 2012 the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports.[27][28]

Russia has a large and sophisticated arms industry, capable of designing and manufacturing high-tech military equipment, including a fifth-generation fighter jet, nuclear powered submarines, firearms, short range/long range ballistic missiles. The value of Russian arms exports totalled $15.7 billion in 2013—second only to the US. Top military exports from Russia include combat aircraft, air defence systems, ships and submarines.[29][30]

In 2014, the Russian economy was the sixth largest in the world by PPP and tenth largest at market exchange rates. Between 2000 and 2012 Russia's energy exports fueled a rapid growth in living standards, with real disposable income rising by 160%.[31] In dollar-denominated terms this amounted to a more than sevenfold increase in disposable incomes since 2000.[32] In the same period, unemployment and poverty more than halved and Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction also rose significantly.[33] This growth was a combined result of the 2000s commodities boom, high oil prices, as well as prudent economic and fiscal policies.[34] However, these gains have been distributed unevenly, as the 110 wealthiest individuals were found in a report by Credit Suisse to own 35% of all financial assets held by Russian households.[35][36] Poor governance means that Russia also has the second-largest volume of illicit money outflows, having lost over $880 billion between 2002 and 2011 in this way.[37] Since 2008 Forbes has repeatedly named Moscow the "billionaire capital of the world".[38][39]

The Russian economy risked going into recession from early 2014 - mainly as a result of the falling oil prices, the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the subsequent capital flight.[40][41] However, the 2014 GDP growth remained positive at 0.6%.[42] In 2015, the Russian economy shrunk by 3.7% and is expected to shrink further in 2016.[43]

In January 2016, the US company Bloomberg rated Russia's economy as the 12th most innovative in the world,[44] up from 14th in January 2015[45] and 18th in January 2014.[46] Russia has the world's 15th highest patent application rate, the 8th highest concentration of high-tech public companies, such as internet and aerospace and the third highest graduation rate of scientists and engineers.[47]

According to official statistics, there has been a reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions in the United Kingdom. These emissions are caused primarily by primary energy consumption. If indirect emissions are accounted for, however, research suggests that UK emissions may have increased since 1990, due largely to manufacture of short-term consumer items overseas.[1]
UK GHG emissions by sector, 1990-2010

Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases continue to drive global warming and ocean acidification.[2] Under the Kyoto protocol the UK Government committed to reducing the levels of CO
2 and five other greenhouse gases by 12.5% below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. These commitments have been surpassed and new targets set.

Consumer prices in Germany rose 0.5 percent year-on-year in January of 2015, up from a 0.3 percent increase in the preceding month and matching preliminary estimates. It is the highest figure since May 2015, as cost of rents and food increased further while cost of energy declined at a slower pace.

Year-on-year, energy cost (total) decreased by 5.8 percent, following a  December. Prices were down the most for: heating oil (-24.3 percent), motor fuels (-5.7 percent). Charges for central and district heating also fell by 9.4 percent.

Prices also decreased for recreation and culture (-4.9 percent, including packege holidays : -10.2 percent), clothing and footwear (-4.3 percent) and housing, water, electricity, gas & other fuels (-0.2 percent). In contrast, cost rose for food (+0.1 percent), health (+0.4 percent), communication (+0.3 percent), education (+0.9 percent), retaurant and hotrls (+0.2 percent) and miscellaneous goods and services (+0.7 percent). 

Iran - officially the Islamic Republic of Iran - , is a country in Western Asia, bordered to the northwest by Armenia and Azerbaijan, with Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Persia, as Iran was known before 1935, was one of the greatest empires of the ancient world, and the country has long maintained a distinct cultural identity within the Islamic world by retaining its own language and adhering to the Shia interpretation of Islam.

Iran’s telecommunications industry is almost entirely state-owned, dominated by the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). Fixed-line penetration in 2004 was relatively well-developed by regional standards, standing at 22 lines per 100 people, higher than Egypt with 14 and Saudi Arabia with 15, although behind the UAE with 27.[2] Iran had more than 1 mobile phone per inhabitant by 2012.[5]

Iran has a population of 70 million with some 56% of Iranians under the age of 25.[2] In 2008, there were more than 52,000 rural offices, providing Telecom services to the villages across the country. The number of fixed telephone lines is above 24 million, with penetration factor of 33.66%. In 2012, there were 43 million internet users in Iran, making the country first in the Middle East in terms of number.[6][7][8]

Iran is among the first five countries which have had a growth rate of over 20 percent and the highest level of development in telecommunication.[9] Iran has been awarded the UNESCO special certificate for providing telecommunication services to rural areas. By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.[10]

According to the Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries (EJISDC), the information and communications technology (ICT) sector had a 1.1-1.3% share of GDP in 2002. About 150,000 people are employed in the ICT sector, including around 20,000 in the software industry.[11] There were 1,200 registered information technology (IT) companies in 2002, 200 of which were involved in software development. Software exports stood around $50 million in 2008.[12]

The government runs the broadcast media, which includes three national radio stations and two national television networks, as well as dozens of local radio and television stations. In 2000 there were 252 radios, 158 television sets, 219 telephone lines, and 110 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, and since then demand for access to the Internet has increased rapidly. In 1998, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (renamed the Ministry of Information & Communication Technology) began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, the Iranian telecom industry's revenues were estimated at $1.2 billion.[13] By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.[10]

The Fourth Five Year Economic Development Plan has proposed the following key benchmarks for 2010: 36 million fixed lines; 50% penetration rate for mobile phones; establishment of reliable rural ICT connections and 30 million internet users. Given the recent developments of the industry, the objectives are very likely to be achieved.[8]

According to one report,[14] Iran has seen above average growth, specially in mobile subscriber numbers. Mobile data services are available but account for a small proportion of total data consumption in 2014. Some telecom parameters of 2012 & 2014 are as below:.

The economy of Pakistan is the 26th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and 41th largest in terms of nominal Gross Domestic Product. Pakistan has a population of over 190 million (the world's 6th-largest), giving it a nominal GDP per capita of $1,427, which ranks 133th in the world. However, Pakistan's undocumented economy is estimated to be 36% of its overall economy, which is not taken into consideration when calculating per capita income.[18] Pakistan is a developing country[19][20][21] and is one of the Next Eleven, the eleven countries that, along with the BRICS, have a potential to become one of the world's large economies in the 21st century.[22] However, after decades of war and social instability, as of 2013, serious deficiencies in basic services such as railway transportation and electric power generation had developed.[23] The economy is semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River.[24][25][26] Primary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals and carpets/rugs.[27]

Growth poles of Pakistan's economy are situated along the Indus River;[25][28] the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centers in the Punjab, coexisting with lesser developed areas in other parts of the country.[25] The economy has suffered in the past from internal political disputes, a fast-growing population, mixed levels of foreign investment.[23] Foreign exchange reserves are bolstered by steady worker remittances, but a growing current account deficit – driven by a widening trade gap as import growth outstrips export expansion – could draw down reserves and dampen GDP growth in the medium term.[29] Pakistan is currently undergoing a process of economic liberalization, including privatization of all government corporations, aimed to attract foreign investment and decrease budget deficit.[30] In 2014, foreign currency reserves crossed $18.4 billion[31] which has led to stable outlook on the long-term rating by Standard & Poor'

This article is about the demographic features of the population of Sri Lanka, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean also called Ceylon and many other names. It is about the size of Ireland. It is about 28 kilometres (18 mi.) off the south-eastern coast of India with a population of about 20 million. Density is highest in the south west where Colombo, the country's main port and industrial center, is located. The net population growth is about 0.7%. Sri Lanka is ethnically, linguistically, and religiously diverse.

According to the 2012 census the population of Sri Lanka was 20,359,439, giving a population density of 325/km2.[5] The population had grown by 5,512,689 (37.1%) since the 1981 census (the last full census), equivalent to an annual growth rate of 1.1%.[5] 3,704,470 (18.2%) lived in urban sectors - areas governed by municipal and urban councils.[6]

5,131,666 (25.2%) of the population were aged 14 or under whilst 2,525,573 (12.4%) were aged 60 or over, leaving a working age (15-59) population of 12,702,700.[7] The dependency ratio was 60.2%.[5] The mean age was 32 years and the median age was 31 years.[5] The sex ratio was 94 males per 100 females.[5] The fertility rate for married females aged 15 or over was 2.65 live births.[8] There were 5,264,282 households of which 3,986,236 (75.7%) were headed by males and 1,278,046 (24.3%) were headed by females.[5]

Of the 15,227,773 aged 15 or over, 10,322,105 (67.8%) were married, 3,927,602 (25.8%) were never married, 792,947 (5.2%) were widowed and 185,119 (1.2%) were divorced or separated.[9]

Of those aged 15 or over, 7,857,370 (51.6%) were economically active, 4,199,558 (27.6%) did housework, 1,431,105 (9.4%) were students, 914,934 (6.0%) were unable to work and 346,084 (2.3%) were pensioners.[10] 521,938 (6.6%) of the economically active were unemployed.[5] 604,540 Sri Lankans were living aboard for more than six months but were intending to return to Sri Lanka, mostly in the Gulf states (373,050 61.7%).[11]

The overall literacy rate for those aged 10 and over was 95.7% but amongst those living in the estate sector it was only 86.1%.[12] Of the 18,615,577 aged 5 or over, 499,563 (2.7%) had received a higher education qualification, 2,293,841 (12.3%) had passed G.C.E. A/L, 3,159,402 (17.0%) had passed G.C.E. O/L and 700,419 (3.8%) had no formal schooling.[13] The remaining 11,962,352 (64.3%) had left school with no qualifications or were currently at school.[13]

On 30 September 2015, Turkey submitted its Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC), with a greenhouse gas reduction target (including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)) of up to 21% below business as usual (BAU) in 2030. Excluding LULUCF emissions, this target is equivalent to a 389% increase on 1990 levels, or a 110% increase on 2012 levels. In comparison, under Turkey’s BAU, emissions are expected to increase by 512% of 1990 levels, or 162% on 2012 levels. Through mitigation plans which target the whole economy, Turkey’s INDC aims to abate up to 255 MtCO2e in 2030 relative to BAU.

We rate this target “inadequate”. Turkey’s commitment is not in line with interpretations of a “fair” approach to reach a 2°C pathway. This means it is not consistent with limiting warming to below 2°C: if all countries adopted this level of ambition, global warming would likely exceed 3-4°C in the 21st century. To make a fair contribution to holding warming below 2°C, Turkey would need to double - or even triple - its post-2020 target.

According to our analysis, with the current policies it already has in place, we find that Turkey can achieve 28% of its proposed INDC target i.e. these policies are expected to abate 71 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030. If the planned policies of the INDC related to the energy sector are implemented,[1] Turkey will achieve 73% of its INDC target. The lion’s share of emissions abatement in Turkey in 2030 depends on its capability to fully exploit its hydro potential. If realised, 39% of the INDC target will be achieved solely by the additional capacity of hydro power installed.[2]

On the other hand, we found that Turkey’s level of ambition in boosting wind and solar capacities seems to decrease after 2023.  The wind energy target from the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) has been reduced from 20 GW in 2023 to 16 GW in 2030 while the solar energy target only doubled to reach 10 GW in 2030. These targets do not reflect the potential of a country with a photovoltaic system performance 50% higher than in Germany[3] (IEA, 2014) and a technical wind power potential of 275 GW[4] (European Commission, 2013)

Our assessment shows that not only does Turkey need to boost its ambition in contributing to limiting global warming but it also needs to set out a plan with detailed measures to achieve its INDC target in 2030 as it did in its NREAP for the year 2023.   

Moreover, it has been reported in the Press (ClimateWire, 2015) that Turkey is planning to quadruple its coal power plants by 2020 to reach 80 GW, when the projection of a business as usual scenario in the INDC was to reach 23 GW in 2020 and 38 GW in 2030 (CAT estimation). If it does this, Turkey would emit an estimated additional 340 MtCO2e in 2020 and 250 MtCO2e in 2030 relative to BAU.[5] This added coal-fired capacity would cancel out all planned abatement measures mentioned in the INDC, and Turkey would not be able to meet its INDC goal.

Turkey ranks among the worst performers in dealing with rising CO2 emissions, according to a joined study submitted by Germanwatch and the Climate Action Network during the U.N. climate summit in Lima.

The report listed the 58 highest emitters worldwide, which together produce nearly 90 percent of all greenhouse gases, and ranks them according to the steps they are taking to tackle climate change. Turkey featured near the bottom of the list in 51st place.

The report suggested that Turkey performed particularly badly in terms of energy efficiency and climate policy.

“According to Turkey’s national climate experts, the country has no national strategic planning policy to explicitly address climate change,” the report stated.

Quite to the contrary, the Turkish government has favored the construction of new coal plants across the country, often with hurried evaluation processes regarding the projects’ environmental impact.

“The fossil fuel industry is growing rapidly and, at least in the energy sector, most policies that are in place lack implementation,” the report also said regarding Turkey.

As is customary in the report, no country was ranked in the top three places, in order to stress that none of them are “doing enough” to tackle climate change.

After the vacant top three, Denmark ranked first, while countries such as Cyprus and Morocco also figured among those with the best performance.

Turkey came higher in the list than other big polluters such as Russia, Canada and Australia, and despite its lowly position actually rose two places compared to last year.

“The reason why Turkey rose by two positions is its promotion of renewables after 2012. No coal plants were opened in 2012 and there were more renewable energy plants integrated to the electricity system,” said Önder Algedik, from the Turkish branch of the “350 Group” founded by environmental activist and author Bill McKibben.

However, Algedik warned that this situation was only temporary and not the result of a planned strategy. “Next year, Turkey will again drop some positions once the plants built last year and in 2014 are added [to the electricity grids],” he said.

Turkey has been facing increasing local criticism as it bids to boost energy production, while the government has also generally failed to adopt comprehensive strategies regarding energy efficiency and development of renewables.

The Environment Ministry is increasingly coming under the spotlight for giving the green light to dozens of energy and construction projects across the country, often after bogus environmental assessment processes.

Vatican City (Listeni/ˈvætᵻkən ˈsɪti/; Italian: Città del Vaticano [tʃitˈta del vatiˈkaːno]; Latin: Civitas Vaticana),[d] officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Città del Vaticano;[e] Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[f] is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842,[3] it is the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world by both area and population.

It is an ecclesiastical[3] or sacerdotal-monarchical[7] state ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377, they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.

Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes),[g] which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe. The independent city-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[8] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.

The name "Zimbabwe" is based on a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe, an ancient ruined city in the country's south-east whose remains are now a protected site. There are two theories on the origin of the word. Many sources hold that the word is derived from dzimba-dza-mabwe, translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as "large houses of stone" (dzimba = plural of imba, "house"; mabwe = plural of bwe, "stone").[17][18][19] The Karanga-speaking Shona people are found around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day province of Masvingo. Archaeologist Peter Garlake claims that "Zimbabwe" is a contracted form of dzimba-hwe which means "venerated houses" in the Zezuru dialect of Shona, and is usually applied to chiefs' houses or graves.[20]

Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia (1898), Rhodesia (1965), and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979). The first recorded use of "Zimbabwe" as a term of national reference was in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema,[21] whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.[22] The term Rhodesia—derived from the surname of Cecil Rhodes, the primary instigator of British colonisation of the territory during the late 19th century—was perceived as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.[21] According to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, and the names Machobana and Monomotapa were proposed before his suggestion, Zimbabwe, prevailed.[23] A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been "Matopos", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo.[22]

It was initially not clear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to "Zimbabweland"[22]—but "Zimbabwe" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement.[21] In a 2001 interview, black nationalist Edson Zvobgo recalled that the name was mentioned by Mawema during a political rally, "and it caught hold, and that was that".[21] The name was subsequently used by the black nationalist factions during the Second Chimurenga campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the Rhodesian Bush War. The most major of these were the Zimbabwe African National Union (led by Robert Mugabe from 1975), and the Zimbabwe African People's Union, led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s.
