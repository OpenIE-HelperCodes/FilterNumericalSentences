Chapter 3
Sixty years ago, Rekha was born in a family of
small farmer in Uttarakhand. She helped her
mother in household chores. While her brothers
went to school, she did not receive any
education. She was dependent on her in laws
after she was widowed immediately after
marriage. She could not be economically
independent and faced neglect. Her brother
helped her to migrate to Delhi.
For the first time, she travelled by bus and
train and was exposed to a large city like Delhi.
After a while, the same city which attracted her
with its buildings, roads, avenues and facilities
and amenities disillusioned her.
With greater familiarity of the city, she
could comprehend the paradoxes. The jhuggi
and slum clusters, traffic jams, congestion,
crimes, poverty, small children begging on
traffic lights, people sleeping on footpaths,
polluted water and air revealed another face of
development. She used to think whether
development and under-development coexist?
Whether development help some segments of
population more than the other? Does
development create haves and have nots? Let
us examine these paradoxes and try to
understand the phenomena.
Of all the paradoxes of our times
mentioned in the story, development is the most
significant one. Development of a few regions,
individuals brought about in a short span of
time leads to poverty and malnutrition for many
along with large scale ecological degradation.
Is development class biased?
Apparently, it is believed that
“Development is freedom” which is often
associated with modernisation, leisure, comfort
and affluence. In the present context,
computerisation, industrialisation, efficient
transport and communication network, large
education system, advanced and modern
medical facilities, safety and security of
individuals, etc. are considered as the symbols
of development. Every individual, community
and government measures its performance or
levels of development in relation to the
availability and access to some of these things.
But, this may be partial and one-sided view of
development. It is often called the western or
euro-centric view of development. For a

npostcolonial country like India, colonisation,
marginalisation, social discrimination and
regional disparity, etc. show the other face of
development.
Thus, for India, development is a mixed
bag of opportunities as well as neglect and
deprivations. There are a few areas like the
metropolitan centres and other developed
enclaves that have all the modern facilities
available to a small section of its population. At
the other extreme of it, there are large rural
areas and the slums in the urban areas that do
not have basic amenities like potable water,
education and health infrastructure available
to majority of this population. The situation is
more alarming if one looks at the distribution
of the development opportunities among
different sections of our society. It is a well-
established fact that majority of the scheduled
castes, scheduled tribes, landless agricultural
labourers, poor farmers and slums dwellers, etc.
are the most marginalised lot. A large segment
of female population is the worst sufferers
among all. It is also equally true that the relative
as well as absolute conditions of the majority
of these marginalised sections have worsened
with the development happening over the years.
Consequently, vast majority of people are
compelled to live under abject poverty and sub-
human conditions.
There is yet another inter-related aspect
of development that has direct bearings on the
deteriorating human conditions. It pertains to
the environmental pollution leading to
ecological crisis. Air, soil, water and noise
pollutions have not only led to the ‘tragedy of
commons’ but these have also threatened the
existence of our society. Consequently, the poor
are being subjected to three inter-related
processes of declining capabilities; i.e. (1) social
capabilities – due to displacement and
weakening social ties (social capital),
(2) environmental capabilities – due to pollution
and, (3) personal capabilities – due to
increasing incidence of diseases and accidents.
This, in turn, has adverse effects on their quality
of life and human development.
Based on the above experiences, it can be
said that the present development has not been
able to address the issues of social injustice,
regional imbalances and environmental
degradation. On the contrary, it is being widely
considered as the prime cause of the social
distributive injustices, deterioration in the
quality of life and human development,
ecological crisis and social unrest. Does
development create, reinforce and perpetuate
these crises? Thus, it was thought to take up
human development as a separate issue against
the prevalent western views of development
which considers development as the remedy to
all the ills including human development,
regional disparities and environmental crisis.
Concerted efforts were made to look at
development critically at various times in the
past. But, most systematic effort towards this
was the publication of the First Human
Development Report by United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990.
Since then, this organisation has been bringing
out World Human Development Report every
year. This report does not only define human
development, make amendments and changes
its indicators but also ranks all the countries

What is Human Development?
“Human development is a process of enlarging the range of people’s choices, increasing their
opportunities for education, health care, income and empowerment and covering the full range of
human choices from a sound physical environment to economic, social and political freedom.”
Thus, enlarging the range of people’s choices is the most significant aspect of human development.
People’s choices may involve a host of other issues, but, living a long and healthy life, to be educated
and have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living including political freedom,
guaranteed human rights and personal self-respect, etc. are considered some of the non-negotiable
aspects of the human development.

India : People and Economyof the world based on the calculated scores.
According to the Human Development Report
1993, “progressive democratisation and
increasing empowerment of people are seen as
the minimum conditions for human
development”. Moreover, it also mentions that
“development must be woven around people,
not the people around development” as was the
case previously.
You have already studied the concepts,
indicators and approaches to human
development and methods of calculating the
index in your book, “Fundamentals of Human
Geography.” In this chapter, let us try to
understand the applicability of these concepts
and indicators to India.

Human Development in India
India with a population of over 1.09 billion is
ranked 127 among 172 countries of the world
in terms of the Human Development Index
(HDI). With the composite HDI value of O.602
India finds herself grouped with countries
showing medium human development
(UNDP 2005).

Low scores in the HDI is a matter of serious
concern but, some reservations have been
expressed about the approach as well as
indicators selected to calculate the index values
and ranking of the states/countries. Lack of
sensitivity to the historical factors like
colonisation, imperialism and neo-imperialism,
socio-cultural factors like human rights
violation, social discrimination on the basis of
race, religion, gender and caste, social problems
like crimes, terrorism, and war and political
factors like nature of the state, forms of the
government (democracy or dictatorship) level
of empowerment are some factors that are very
crucial in determining the nature of human
development. These aspects have special
significance in case of India and many other
developing countries.
Using the indicators selected by the UNDP,
the Planning Commission of India also
prepared the Human Development Report for
India. It used states and the Union Territories
as the units of analysis. Subsequently, each
state government also started preparing the
state level Human Development Reports, using
districts as the units of analysis. Although, the
final HDI by the Planning Commission of India
has been calculated by taking the three
indicators as discussed in the book entitled,
“Fundamentals of Human Geography”, yet,
this report also discussed other indicators like
economic attainment, social empowerment,
social distributive justice, accessibility, hygiene
and various welfare measures undertaken by
the state. Some of the important indicators have
been discussed in the following pages.

University Press. pp.219-222.
Indicators of Economic Attainments
Rich resource base and access to these
resources by all, particularly the poor, down
trodden and the marginalised is the key to
productivity, well-being and human
development. Gross National Product (GNP)
and its per capita availability are taken as
measures to assess the resource base/
endowment of any country. For India, it is
estimated that its GDP was Rs. 3200 thousand
crores (at current Price) and accordingly, per
capita income was Rs. 20,813 at current prices.
Apparently, these figures indicate an impressive
Human Development
25performance but, prevalence of poverty,
deprivation, malnutrition, illiteracy, various
types of prejudices and above all social
distributive injustices and large-scale regional
disparities belie all the so-called economic
achievements.
There are a few developed States like
Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and
Delhi that have per capita income more than
Rs. 4,000 (figure at 1980-81 prices) per year
and there are a large number of poorer States
like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, etc.
which have recorded per capita income less
than Rs. 2,000. Corresponding to these
disparities, the developed states have higher per
capita consumption expenditure as compared
to the poorer states. It was estimated to be more
than Rs. 690 per capita per month in States
like Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra and
Gujarat and below Rs. 520 per capita per
month in States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, etc. These
variations are indicative of some other deep-
seated economic problems like poverty,
unemployment and under-employment.
The disaggregated data of poverty for
the states show that there are States like
Orissa and Bihar which have recorded more
than 40 per cent of their population living
below the poverty line. The States of Madhya
Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal
Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland have more
than 30 per cent of their population below
poverty line. “Poverty is a state of
deprivation. In absolute terms it reflects the
inability of an individual to satisfy certain
basic needs for a sustained, healthy and
reasonably productive living.” Employment
rate for educated youth is 25 per cent. Jobless
growth and rampant unemployment are some

Indicators of a Healthy Life
Life free from illness and ailment and living a
reasonably long life span are indicative of a
healthy life. Availability of pre and post natal
health care facilities in order to reduce infant
mortality and post delivery deaths among
mothers, old age health care, adequate nutrition
and safety of individual are some important
measures of a healthy and reasonably long life.
India has done reasonably well in some of the
health indicators like decline in death rate from
25.1 per thousand in 1951 to 8.1 per thousand
in 1999 and infant mortality from 148 per
thousand to 70 during the same period.
Similarly, it also succeeded in increasing life
expectancy at birth from 37.1 years to 62.3
years for males and 36.2 to 65.3 years for
females from 1951 to 1999. Though, these are
great achievements, a lot needs to be done.
Similarly, it has also done reasonably well in
bringing down birth rate from 40.8 to 26.1
during the same years, but it still is much higher
than many developed countries.
The situation is more alarming when seen
in the context of gender specific and rural and
urban health indicators. India has recorded
declining female sex ratio. The findings of 2001
Census of India are very disturbing particularly
in case of child sex ratio between 0-6 age
groups. The other significant features of the
report are, with the exception of Kerala, the
child sex ratio has declined in all the states
and it is the most alarming in the developed
state of Haryana and Punjab where it is
below 800 female children per thousand
male children. What factors are responsible for
it? Is it the social attitude or scientific methods
of sex-determination?

Can literacy reflect the status of Human Developments?
Debate.
Table 3.3 showing the percentage of
literates in India reveals some interesting
features:
• Overall literacy in India is
approximately 65. 4 per cent (2001).
while female literacy is 54.16 per cent.
• Total literacy as well as female literacy
is higher than the national average in
most of the states from south India.
• There are wide regional disparities in
literacy rate across the states of India.
There is a state like Bihar which has
very low (47.53 per cent) literacy and
there are states like Kerala and
Mizoram which have literacy rates of
90.92 and 88.49 per cent respectively.
Apart from the spatial variations,
percentage of literates in the rural areas and
among the marginalised sections of our society
such as females, scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes, agricultural labourers, etc. is very low.
It is worth mentioning here that though, there
has been improvement in the percentage of
literates among the marginalised section yet the
gap between the richer and the marginalised
sections of the population has increased over
the years.

India has been placed among the
countries showing medium human
development. What is the rank of India among
the 172 countries of the world? As indicated
in table 3.4 Kerala with the composite index
value of 0.638 is placed at the top rank
followed by Punjab (0.537), Tamil Nadu (0.531)
Maharashtra (0.523) and Haryana (0.509). As
expected, states like Bihar (0.367), Assam
(0.386), Uttar Pradesh (0.388), Madhya
Pradesh (0.394) and Orissa (0.404) are at the
bottom among the 15 major states in India.
There are several socio-political, economic
and historical reasons for such a state of
affairs. Kerala is able to record the highest value
in the HDI largely due to its impressive
performance in achieving near hundred per
cent literacy (90.92 per cent) in 2001. In a
different scenario the states like Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Assam and Uttar Pradesh
have very low literacy. For example, total
literacy rate for Bihar was as low as 60.32 per
cent during the same year. States showing
higher total literacy rates have less gaps
between the male and female literacy rates. For
Kerala, it is 6.34 per cent, while it is 26.75 per
cent in Bihar and 25.95 per cent in Madhya
Pradesh.d

Can you find out the
causes of the above
problems?
Apart from the educational attainment, the
levels of economic development too play
significant impacts on HDI. Economically
developed states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu
and Punjab and Haryana have higher value of
HDI as compared to states like Assam, Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh, etc.
Re gio nal d isto rtio ns and s o c i a l
disparities which developed during the
colonial period continue to play an important
role in the Indian economy, polity and society.
The Government of India has made concerted
efforts to institutionalise the balanced
development with its main focus on social
distributive justice through planned
development. It has made significant
achievements in most of the fields but, these
are still below the desired level.
o
n
Population E
, nvironment and Development
Development in general and human
development in particular is a complex concept
used in social sciences. It is complex because
for ages it was thought that development is a
substantive concept and once it is achieved it
will address all the socio-cultural and
environmental ills of the society. Though,
development has brought in significant
improvement in the quality of life in more than
one way but increasing regional disparities,
social inequalities, discriminations, deprivations,
displacement of people, abuse of human rights
and undermining human values and
environmental degradation have also increased.
Considering the gravity and sensitivity of
the issues involved, the UNDP in its Human
Human Development
29Development Report 1993, tried to amend some
of the implicit biases and prejudices which were
entrenched in the concept of development.
People’s participation and their security were the
major issues in the Human Development Report
of 1993. It also emphasised on progressive
democratisation and increasing empowerment
of people as minimum conditions for human
development. The report recognised greater
constructive role of ‘Civil Societies’ in bringing
about peace and human development. The civil
society should work for building up opinion for
reduction in the military expenditure, de-
mobilisation of armed forces, transition from
defence to production of basic goods and services
and particularly disarmament and reduction in
the nuclear warheads by the developed
countries. In a nuclearised world, peace and
well-being are major global concerns.
At the other extreme of this approach lie
the views expressed by the Neo-Malthusians,
environmentalists and radical ecologists. They
believe that for a happy and peaceful social life
proper balance between population and
resources is a necessary condition. According
to these thinkers, the gap between the resources
and population has widened after eighteenth
century. There have been marginal expansion
in the resources of the world in the last three
hundred years but there has been phenomenal
growth in the human population. Development
has only contributed in increasing the multiple
uses of the limited resources of the world while
there has been enormous increase in the demand
for these resources. Therefore, the prime task
before any development activity is to maintain
parity between population and resources.
Scholar like Sir Robert Malthus was the first
one to voice his concern about the growing
scarcity of resources as compared to the human
population. Apparently this argument looks
logical and convincing, but a critical look will
reveal certain intrinsic flaws such as resources
are not a neutral category. It is not the
availability of resources that is as important as
their social distribution. Resources everywhere
are unevenly distributed. Rich countries and
people have access to large resource baskets
while the poor find their resources shrinking.
Moreover, unending pursuit for the control of
more and more resources by the powerful and
use of the same for exhibiting ones prowess is
the prime cause of conflicts as well as the
apparent contradictions between population-
resource and development.
Indian culture and civilisation have been
very sensitive to the issues of population,
resource and development for a long time. It
would not be incorrect to say that the ancient
scriptures were essentially concerned about the
balance and harmony among the elements of
nature. Mahatma Gandhi in the recent times
advocated the reinforcement of the harmony and
balance between the two. He was quite
apprehensive about the on-going development
particularly the way industrialisation has
institutionalised the loss of morality, spirituality,
self-reliance, non-violence and mutual co-
operation and environment. In his opinion,
austerity for individual, trusteeship of social
wealth and non-violence are the key to attain
higher goals in the life of an individual as well as
that of a nation. His views were also re-echoed
in the Club of Rome Report “Limits to Growth”
(1972), Schumacher’s book “Small is
Beautiful” (1974), Brundtland Commission’s
Report “Our Common Future” (1987) and
finally in the “Agenda-21 Report of the Rio
Conference” (1993).
