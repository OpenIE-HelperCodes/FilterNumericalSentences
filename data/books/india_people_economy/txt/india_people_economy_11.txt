INTERNATIONAL
TRADE
You have already studied about the various
aspects of International trade in the book
Fundamentals of Human Geography.
International Trade is mutually beneficial as
no country is self-sufficient. India’s
International trade has undergone a sea change
in recent years in terms of volume, composition
as well as direction. Although India’s
contribution in the world trade is as low as one
per cent of the total volume, yet it plays a
significant role in the world economy.
Let us examine the changing pattern of
India’s International trade. In 1950-51, India’s
external trade was worth Rs.1,214 crore, which
rose to Rs. 22,09,270 crore in 2009-10. Can
you calculate the percentage growth in 2009-10
over 1950-51? There are numerous reasons for
this sharp rise in overseas trade, such as, the
momentum picked up by the manufacturing
sectors, the liberal policies of the government and
the diversification of markets.
The nature of India’s foreign trade has
changed over the years (Table 11.1). Though
there has been an increase in the total volume
of import and export, the value of import
continued to be higher than that of exports.
There has also been an increase in trade deficit
over the last couple of years. This increase in
deficit is attributed to the price rise of crude
petroleum which forms a major component of
India’s import list.

Study the data in table 11.2 and answer the following
questions :
Why is the export of agricultural and allied products
declining continuously after 1997-98?
After attaining a peak in 1999-2000, why has the export
of manufacturing goods started decreasing?
Draw bar diagram to show the trends of exports of all
items given in the table. Use pen/pencil of different
colours.
The decline in traditional items is largely due
to the tough international competition. Amongst
the agricultural products, there is a great decline
in the exports of traditional items such as coffee,
spices, tea, pulses, etc. though an increase has
been registered in floricultural products, fresh
fruits, marine products and sugar, etc.
Manufacturing sector alone accounted for
68.0 per cent of India’s total value of export in
2010-11. Engineering goods have shown a
significant growth in the export list. China and
other East Asian countries are our major
competitors. Gems and jewellery contributes a
larger share of India’s foreign trade.

As has already been mentioned, the
composition of commodities in India’s
international trade has been undergoing a
change over the years. The share of agriculture
and allied products has declined whereas
shares of petroleum and crude products and
other commodities have increased. The shares
of ore minerals and manufactured goods have
largely remained constant over the years from
1997-98 to 2003-04. The increase in the share
of petroleum products is due to a rise in
petroleum prices as well as increase in India’s
refining capacity.
Study table 11.3 and select major commodities
exported in 2010-11 and draw bar diagram.
Changing Patterns of the Composition of
India’s Import
India faced serious food shortage during 1950s
and 1960s. The major item of import at that
time was foodgrain, capital goods, machinery
and equipments. The balance of payment was

adverse as imports were more than export in
spite of all the efforts of import substitution.
After 1970s, foodgrain import was discontinued
due to the success of green revolution but the
energy crisis of 1973 pushed the prices of
petroleum, and import budget was also pushed
up. Foodgrain import was replaced by fertilisers
and petroleum. Machine and equipment,
special steel, edible oil and chemicals largely
make the import basket. Examine the changing
pattern of imports in Table 11.4 and try to
comprehend the shifts.
Table 11.4 shows that there is a steep rise
in imports of petroleum products. It is used not
only as a fuel but also as an industrial raw
material. It indicates the tempo of rising
industrialisation and better standard of living.
Sporadic price rise in the international market
is another reason for the same. Import of capital
goods maintained a steady increase due to rising
transport equipment, manufacturers of metals
and machine tools were the main items of
capital goods. Import of food and allied
products declined with a fall in imports of
edible oils. Other major items of India’s import
include pearls and semi precious stones, gold
and silver, metalliferrous ores and metal scrap,
non-ferrous metals, electronic goods, etc. The
details of Indian imports of principal
commodities during 2010-11 have been given
in table 11.5.
Based on table 11.5, few activities may be
undertaken:
Arrange the items in ascending or
descending order and write the names of
the first five major items of India’s import
list of 2010-11.
Why does India import edible oil in spite of
being an agriculturally rich country?
Select five most important and five least
important items and represent them by bar
diagram.
Can you identify some items of imports for
which substitutes can be developed in
India?

India is a success story in terms of
diversification of export and import markets.
The share of Asia and ASEAN in total trade
increased from 33.3 per cent in 2000-01 to 57.3
per cent in the first half of 2011-12, while that
of Europe and America fell from 42.5 per cent
to 30.8 per cent respectively. This has helped
India weather the global crisis emanating from
Europe and America.

An interesting development in the direction
of India’s trade is that the USA which was in
first position in 2003-04 has been relegated to
third position in 2010-11, with the UAE
becoming India’s largest trading partner,
followed by China. This position continued from
2008-09 to 2010-11.

India aims to double its share in the
international trade within the next five years. It
has already started adopting suitable measures
such as import liberalisation, reduction in
import duties, de-licensing and change from
process to product patents.
Draw a multiple bar diagram to represent the major
trading partners.
Most of India’s foreign trade is carried
through sea and air routes. However, a small
portion is also carried through land route to
neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and Pakistan.

India is surrounded by sea from three sides and
is bestowed with a long coastline. Water
provides a smooth surface for very cheap
transport provided there is no turbulence. India
Fig. 11.3 : Unloading of goods on port
has a long tradition of sea faring and developed
many ports with place name suffixed with
pattan meaning port. An interesting fact about
ports in India is that its west coast has more
seaports than its east coast.
Can you find out the reasons for the
variations in the location of ports along the
two coasts?
Though ports have been in use since
ancient times, the emergence of ports as
gateways of international trade became
important after the coming of the European
traders and colonisation of the country by the
British. This led to the variation in the size and
quality of ports. There are some ports which
have very vast area of influence and some have
limited area of influence. At present, India has
12 major ports and 185 minor or intermediate
ports. In case of the major ports, central
government decides the policy and plays
regulatory functions. The minor ports are there
whose policy and functions are regulated by
state governments. The major ports handle
larger share of the total traffic. The 12 major
ports handled about 71 per cent of the country’s
oceanic traffic in 2008-09.
The British used the ports as suction
points of the resources from their hinterlands.
The extension of railways towards the interior
facilitated the linking of the local markets to
regional markets, regional markets to national
markets and national markets to the
international markets. This trend continued till
1947. It was expected that the country’s
independence will reverse the process, but the
partition of the country snatched away two very
important ports i.e. Karachi port went to
Pakistan and Chittagong port to the erstwhile
east-Pakistan and now Bangladesh. To
compensate the losses, many new ports like the
Kandla in the west and the Diamond Harbour
near Kolkata on river Hugli in the east were
developed.
Despite this major setback, Indian ports
continued to grow after the Independence.
Today Indian ports are handling large volumes
of domestic as well as overseas trade. Most of
the ports are equipped with modern
infrastructure. Previously the development and
modernisation was the responsibility of the
government agencies, but considering the
increase in function and need to bring these
ports at par with the international ports, private
entrepreneurs have been invited for the
modernisation of ports in India.
The capacity of Indian ports increased from
20 million tonnes of cargo handling in 1951 to
more than 586 million tonnes in 2008-09.
International Trade 129
2015-16Fig. 11.4 : India – Major Ports and Sea Routes
130 India : People and Economy
2015-16Some of the Indian ports along with their
hinterlands are as follows :
Kandla Port situated at the head of Gulf of
Kuchchh has been developed as a major port to
cater to the needs of western and north western
parts of the country and also to reduce the
pressure at Mumbai port. The port is specially
designed to receive large quantities of petroleum
and petroleum products and fertiliser. The
offshore terminal at Vadinar has been developed
to reduce the pressure at Kandla port.
Demarcation of the boundary of the
hinterland would be difficult as it is not fixed
over space. In most of the cases, hinterland of
one port may overlap with that of the other.
Mumbai is a natural harbour and the
biggest port of the country. The port is situated
closer to the general routes from the countries
of Middle East, Mediterranean countries, North
Africa, North America and Europe where the
major share of country’s overseas trade is
carried out. The port is 20 km long and 6-10
km wide with 54 berths and has the country’s
largest oil terminal. M.P., Maharashtra, Gujarat,
U.P. and parts of Rajasthan constitute the main
hinterlands of Mumbai ports.
Jawaharlal Nehru Port at Nhava Sheva
was developed as a satellite port to relieve the
pressure at the Mumbai port. It is the largest
container port in India.
Marmagao Port, situated at the entrance
of the Zuari estuary, is a natural harbour in
Goa. It gained significance after its remodelling
in 1961 to handle iron-ore exports to Japan.
Construction of Konkan railway has
considerably extended the hinterland of this
port. Karnataka, Goa, Southern Maharashtra
constitute its hinterland.
New Mangalore Port is located in the state
of Karnataka and caters to the needs of the
export of iron-ore and iron-concentrates. It also
handles fertilisers, petroleum products, edible
oils, coffee, tea, wood pulp, yarn, granite stone,
molasses, etc. Karnataka is the major
hinterland for this port.
Kochchi Port, situated at the head of
Vembanad Kayal, popularly known as the
“Queen of the Arabian Sea,” is also a natural
harbour. This port has an advantageous
location being close to the Suez-Colombo route.
It caters to the needs of Kerala, southern-
Karnataka and south western Tamil Nadu.
Kolkata Port is located on the Hugli river,
128 km inland from the Bay of Bengal. Like the
Mumbai port, this port was also developed by
the British. Kolkata had the initial advantage
of being the capital of British India. The port
has lost its significance considerably on account
of the diversion of exports to the other ports
such as Vishakhapatnam, Paradwip and its
satellite port, Haldia.
Kolkata port is also confronted with the
problem of silt accumulation in the Hugli river
which provides a link to the sea. Its hinterland
covers U.P., Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal,
Sikkim and the north-eastern states. Apart from
this, it also extends ports facilities to our
neighbouring land-locked countries such as
Nepal and Bhutan.
Haldia Port is located 105 km
downstream from Kolkata. It has been
constructed to reduce the congestion at Kolkata
port. It handles bulk cargo like iron ore, coal,
petroleum, petroleum products and fertilisers,
jute, jute products, cotton and cotton yarn, etc.
Paradwip Port is situated in the Mahanadi
delta, about 100 km from Cuttack. It has the
deepest harbour specially suited to handle very
large vessels. It has been developed mainly to
handle large-scale export of iron-ore. Orissa,
Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are the parts of
its hinterland.
Visakhapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh
is a land-locked harbour, connected to the sea
by a channel cut through solid rock and sand.
An outer harbour has been developed for
handling iron-ore, petroleum and general
cargo. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are the
main hinterland for this port.
Chennai Port is one of the oldest ports on
the eastern coast. It is an artificial harbour built

132 India : People and Economy
2015-16in 1859. It is not much suitable for large ships
because of the shallow waters near the coast.
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry are its hinterland.
Ennore, a newly developed port in Tamil
Nadu, has been constructed 25 km north of
Chennai to relieve the pressure at Chennai port.
Tuticorin Port was also developed to
relieve the pressure of Chennai port. It deals
with a variety of cargo including coal, salt, food
grains, edible oils, sugar, chemicals and
petroleum products.
There were 19 international airports
functioning in the country (February 2013).
They are Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bengaluru,
Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Hyderabad,
Kochchi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram,
Srinagar, Jaipur, Calicut, Port Blair, Nagpur,
Tiruchirapalli and Coimbatore.
You have already studied about the air
transport in the previous chapter. You consult
the chapter on transport to find out the main
features of air transport in India.
Airports
Air transport plays an important role in the
international trade. It has the advantage of
taking the least time for carriage and handling
high value or perishable goods over long
distances. It is very costly and unsuitable for
carrying heavy and bulky commodities. This
ultimately reduces the participation of this
sector in the international trade as compared
to the oceanic routes.
Name the nearest domestic and international airports
from your place. Identify the state with maximum number
of domestic airports.
Identify four cities where maximum number of air routes
converge and also give reasons for this.
