TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATION
We use many items in our daily life. From tooth
paste to our bed tea, milk, clothes, soaps, food
items, etc. are required every day. All these can
be purchased from the market. Have you ever
thought as to how these items are brought from
the site of production? All the production is
meant for consumption. From the fields and
factory, the produce is brought to the place from
where consumers purchase it. It is the
transportation of these items from the site of
their production to the market which make
them available to the consumer.
We not only use material things like fruits,
vegetables, books, clothes, etc. but also use
ideas, views and messages in our daily life. Do
you know we exchange our views, ideas and
messages from one place to another or one
individual to another while communicating with
the help of various means?
The use of transport and communication
depends upon our need to move things from
place of their availability to the place of their
use. Human-beings use various methods to
move goods, commodities, ideas from one place
to another.
The following diagram shows the major
means of transportation.

The pathways and unmetalled roads have been
used for transportation in India since ancient
times. With the economic and technological
development, metalled roads and railways were
developed to move large volume of goods and
2015-16people from one place to another. Ropeways,
cableways and pipelines were devised to cater
to the demands of transporting specific goods
under special circumstances.
Road Transport
India has one of the largest road networks in
the world with a total length of 42.3 lakh km
(2008-09). About 85 per cent of passenger and
(1961) was introduced to improve the
conditions of roads in India. However, roads
continue to concentrate in and around urban
centres. Rural and remote areas had the least
connectivity by road.
For the purpose of construction and
maintenance, roads are classified as National
Highways (NH), State Highways(SH), Major
District Roads and Rural Roads.
Rain-soaked : Nomads go about their routine during an early morning
downpour in Srinagar. Traffic on the 300-km Srinagar-Jammu and 434-
km Srinagar-Leh National Highways is suspended as upper reaches of
J&K saw heavy snowfall while rain lashed the plains.

70 per cent of freight traffic are carried by roads
every year. Road transport is relatively suitable
for shorter distance travel.
Sher Shah Suri built the Shahi (Royal) road
to strengthen and consolidate his empire
from the Indus Valley to the Sonar Valley
in Bengal. This road was renamed the
Grand Trunk (GT) road during the British
period, connecting Calcutta and Peshawar.
At present, it extends from Amritsar to
Kolkata. It is bifurcated into 2 segments :
(a) National Highway(NH)-1 from Delhi to
Amritsar, and (b) NH- 2 from Delhi to Kolkata.
Road transport in modern sense was very
limited in India before World War-II. The first
serious attempt was made in 1943 when
‘Nagpur Plan’ was drawn. This plan could not
be implemented due to lack of coordination
among the princely states and British India.
After Independence, twenty-year road plan
National Highways
The main roads which are constructed and
maintained by the Central Government are
known as the National Highways. These roads
are meant for inter-state transport and
movement of defence men and material in
strategic areas. These also connect the state
capitals, major cities, important ports, railway
junctions, etc. The length of the National
Highways has increased from 19,700 km in
1951 to 70,934 km in 2008-09. The National
Highways constitute only 1.67 per cent of the
total road length but carry 40 per cent of the
road traffic. (Table 10.1)
The National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) was operationalised in 1995. It is an
autonomous body under the Ministry of
Surface Transport. It is entrusted with the
responsibility of development, maintenance
and operation of National Highways. This is also
the apex body to improve the quality of the roads
designated as National Highways.

Development Projects
NHAI has taken up some major projects in
the country under different phases :
Golden Quadrilateral : It comprises
construction of 5,846 km long 4/6 lane, high
density traffic corridor, to connect India’s four
big metro cities of Delhi-Mumbai-Chennai-
Kolkata. With the construction of Golden
Quadrilateral, the time- distance and cost
of movement among the mega cities of India
will be considerably minimised.
North-South and East-West Corridors :
North-South corridor aims at connecting
Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir with
Kaniyakumari in Tamil Nadu (including
Kochchi-Salem Spur) with 4,076 km long
road. The East-West Corridor has been planned
to connect Silchar in Assam with the port town
of Porbandar in Gujarat with 3,640 km of
road length.
State Highways
These are constructed and maintained by state
governments. They join the state capitals with
district headquarters and other important
towns. These roads are connected to the
National Highways. These constitute 4 per cent
of total road length in the country.
District Roads
These roads are the connecting link between
District Headquarters and the other important
nodes in the district. They account for 14 per
cent of the total road length of the country.
These roads are vital for providing links in the
rural areas. About 80 per cent of the total road
length in India are categorised as rural roads.
There is regional variation in the density of rural
road because these are influenced by the nature
of the terrain?
Fig. 10.2 : Road constructed under the Pradhan
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna
Why are the rural roads’ density very low
in hilly, plateau and forested areas? Why
does the quality of rural roads deteriorate
away from the urban centres?
Other Roads
Other roads include Border Roads and
International Highways. The Border Road
Organisation (BRO) was established in May
1960 for accelerating economic development
and strengthening defence preparedness
through rapid and coordinated improvement
of strategically important roads along the
northern and north-eastern boundary of the

2015-16country. It is a premier multifaceted construction
agency. It has constructed roads in high altitude
mountainous terrain joining Chandigarh with
Manali (Himachal Pradesh) and Leh (Ladakh).
This road runs at an average altitude of 4,270
metres above the mean sea level.
Fig. 10.4 : Khardung La Pass in Jammu & Kashmir
Apart from the construction and
maintenance of roads in strategically sensitive
areas, the BRO also undertakes snow
clearance in high altitude areas. The
international highways are meant to promote
the harmonious relationship with the
neighbouring countries by providing effective
links with India. (Fig. 10.5 and 10.6)
The distribution of roads is not uniform in
the country. Density of roads (length of roads
per 100 square km of area) varies from only
12.14 km in Jammu and Kashmir to 517.77
km in Kerala with a national average of 142.68
km in 2011. The density of road is high in most
of the northern states and major southern
states. It is low in the Himalayan region, north-
eastern region, Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan. Why does this variation occur?
Nature of terrain and the level of economic
development are the main determinants of
density of roads. Construction of roads is easy
and cheaper in the plain areas while it is difficult
and costly in hilly and plateau areas. Therefore,
not only the density but also the quality of roads
is relatively better in plains as compared to
roads in high altitude areas, rainy and forested
regions.

Indian railways network is one of the longest in
the world. It facilitates the movement of both
freight and passengers and contributes to the
growth of economy. Mahatma Gandhi said, the
Indian railways “brought people of diverse
cultures together to contribute to India’s
freedom struggle.”
Indian Railway was introduced in 1853,
when a line was constructed from Bombay to
Thane covering a distance of 34 km.
Indian Railways is the largest government
undertaking in the country. The length of Indian
Railways network is 64460 km. as on 31 March
2011. Its very large size puts lots of pressure
on a centralised railway management system.

2015-16On the basis of width of the track of Indian
Railways, three categories have been made:
Broad gauge: The distance between rails in
broad gauge is 1.676 metre. The total length
of broad gauge lines was 55188 km in 2011.
Metre gauge: The distance between rails
is one metre. Its total length was 6809 km
in 2011.
Narrow gauge: The distance between the rails
in this case is 0.762 metre or 0.610 metre.
The total length of narrow guage was 2463 km
in 2011. It is generally confined to hilly areas.
Indian Railways has launched extensive
programme to convert the metre and narrow
gauges to broad gauge. Moreover, steam
engines have been replaced by diesel and
electric engines. This step has increased the
speed as well as the haulage capacity.
The replacement of steam engines run by
coal has also improved the environment of the
stations.
Metro rail has revolutionlised the urban
transport system in Kolkata and Delhi.
replacement of diesel buses by CNG run
vehicles along with introduction of metro is a
welcome step towards controlling the air
pollution in urban centres.
Areas around towns, raw material
producing areas and of plantations and other
commercial crops, hill stations and cantonment
towns were well-connected by railways from the
British colonial era. These were mostly
developed for the exploitation of resources. After
the Independence of the country, railway routes
have been extended to other areas too. The most
significant development has been the
development of Konkan Railway along the
western coast providing a direct link between
Mumbai and Mangaluru.
Railway continues to remain the main means
of transport for the masses. Railway network is
relatively less dense in the hill states, north eastern
states, central parts of India and Rajasthan.
Water Transport
Waterways is an important mode of transport
for both passenger and cargo traffic in India. It
is the cheapest means of transport and is most
suitable for carrying heavy and bulky material.
It is a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of
transport. The water transport is of two types–
(a) inland waterways, and (b) oceanic waterways.
Inland Waterways
It was the chief mode of transport before the
advent of railways. It, however, faced tough
competition from road and railway transport.
Moreover, diversion of river water for irrigation
Konkan Railway
One of the important achievements of
Indian Railways has been the
construction of Konkan Railway in 1998.
It is 760 km long rail route connecting
Roha in Maharashtra to Mangalore in
Karnataka. It is considered an
engineering marvel. It crosses 146
rivers, streams, nearly 2000 bridges and
91 tunnels. Asia’s largest tunnel which
is nearly 6.5 km long, also lies on this
route. The states of Maharashtra, Goa
and Karnataka are partners in this
undertaking.

2015-16purposes made them non navigable in large
parts of their courses. India has 14,500 km of
navigable waterways, contributing about 1% to
the country’s transportation. It comprises rivers,
canals, backwaters, creeks, etc. At present,
5,685 km of major rivers are navigable by
mechanised flat bottom vessels.
For the development, maintenance and
regulation of national waterways in the country,
the Inland Waterways Authority was set up in
1986. The following waterways have been
declared as the National Waterways by the
Government (Table 10.4).

Udyogmandal canal (14 km).
120 India : People and Economy
2015-16Inland Waterways Authority has also
identified ten other inland waterways, which
could be upgraded. The backwaters (Kadal) of
Kerala has special significance in Inland
Waterway. Apart from providing cheap means
of transport, they are also attracting large
number of tourists in Kerala. The famous Nehru
Trophy Boat Race (VALLAMKALI) is also held
in the backwaters.
Oceanic Routes
India has a vast coastline of approximate 7,517
km, including islands. Twelve major and 185
minor ports provide infrastructural support to
these routes. Oceanic routes play an important
role in the transport sector of India’s economy.
Approximately 95 per cent of India’s foreign
trade by volume and 70 per cent by value moves
through ocean routes. Apart from international
trade, these are also used for the purpose of
transportation between the islands and the rest
of the country.
Air Transportation
Air transport is the fastest means of movement
from one place to the other. It has reduced
distances by minimising the travel time. It is
very essential for a vast country like India,
where distances are large and the terrain and
climatic conditions are diverse.
Air transport in India made a beginning
in 1911 when airmail operation commenced
over a little distance of 10 km between
Allahabad and Naini. But its real development
took place in post-Independent period. The
Airport Authority of India is responsible for
providing safe, efficient air traffic and
aeronautical communication services in the
Indian Air Space. The authority manages 125
airports.
The air transport in India is managed by
two corporations, Air India and Indian Airlines
after nationalisation. Now many private
companies have also started passenger services.
Air India
Air India provides International Air Services for
both passengers and cargo traffic. It connects
all the continents of the world through its
services.
History of Indian Airlines
1911 – Air transport in India was launched between Allahabad and Naini.
1947 – Air transport was provided by four major companies namely Indian National Airways, Tata
Sons Limited, Air Services of India and Deccan Airways.
1951 – Four more companies
joined the services, Bharat
Airways, Himalayan Aviation
Limited, Airways India and Kalinga
Airlines.
1953 – Air transport was
nationalised and two Corporations,
Air India International and Indian
Airlines were formed. Now Indian
Airlines is known as ‘Indian’.

2015-16The country’s largest state-owned domestic
carrier, Indian Airlines dropped the word
‘Airlines’ from its name and is known as
‘Indian’ w.e.f. December 8, 2005. The new
brand name ‘Indian’ now appears on both
sides of the fuselage. The logo on the
orange tail depicting ‘IA’ has also been
changed. It has been replaced by a new
logo which is a partly visible blue wheel and
is inspired by the Sun Temple at Konark
(Odisha), symbolising timeless motion,
convergence and divergence. It also
embodies strength as well as trust that has
stood the test of time.
In 2010, domestic movement involved
520.21 lakh passengers and about 23 lakh
metric tonnes of cargo.
Pawan Hans is the helicopter service
operating in hilly areas and is widely used by
tourists in north-eastern sector.
In addition, Pawan Hans Limited mainly
provides helicopter services to petroleum sector
and for tourism.
Open Sky Policy
To help the Indian exporters and make their
export more competitive, the government had
introduced an Open Sky Policy for cargo in
April 1992. Under this policy, foreign airlines
or association of exporters can bring any
freighters to the country.
constructed by OIL from Naharkatiya oilfield
in Assam to Barauni refinery in Bihar. It was
further extended up to Kanpur in 1966.
Another extensive network of pipelines has been
constructed in the western region of India of
which Ankleshwar-Koyali, Mumbai High-
Koyali and Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ)
are most important. Recently, a 1256 km long
pipeline connecting Salaya (Gujarat) with
Mathura (U.P.) has been constructed. It supplies
crude oil from Gujarat to Punjab (Jalandhar)
via Mathura. OIL is in the process of
constructing of 660 km long pipeline from
Numaligarh to Siliguri.
Communication Networks
Human beings have evolved different methods
of communication over time. In earlier times,
the messages were delivered by beating the
drum or hollow tree trunks, giving indications
through smoke or fire or with the help of fast
runners. Horses, camels, dogs, birds and other
animals were also used to send messages.
Initially, the means of communication were also
the means of transportation. Invention of post-
office, telegraph, printing press, telephone,
satellite, etc has made the communication much
faster and easier. Development in the field of
science and technology has significantly
contributed in bringing about revolution in the
field of communication.
People use different modes of
communication to convey the messages. On the
basis of scale and quality, the mode of
communication can be divided into following
categories :
Oil and Gas Pipelines
Pipelines are the most convenient and efficient
mode of transporting liquids and gases over
long distances. Even solids can also be
transported by pipelines after converting them
into slurry. Oil India Limited (OIL) under the
administrative set up of the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Gas is engaged in the
exploration, production and transportation of
crude oil and natural gas. It was incorporated
in 1959 as a company. Asia’s first cross country
pipeline covering a distance of 1,157 km was

2015-16Personal Communication System
Among all the personal communication system
internet is the most effective and advanced one. It
is widely used in urban areas. It enables the user
to establish direct contact through e-mail to get
access to the world of knowledge and information.
It is increasingly used for e-commerce and
carrying out money transactions. The internet is
like a huge central warehouse of data, with
detailed information on various items. The
network through internet and e-mail provides an
efficient access to information at a comparatively
low cost. It enables us with the basic facilities of
direct communication. You might have noticed
the proliferation of cyber cafes in urban areas.
Mass Communication System
Radio
Radio broadcasting started in India in 1923 by
the Radio Club of Bombay. Since then, it gained
immense popularity and changed the socio-
cultural life of people. Within no time, it made a
place in every household of the country.
Government took this opportunity and brought
this popular mode of communication under its
control in 1930 under the Indian Broadcasting
System. It was changed to All India Radio in
1936 and to Akashwani in 1957.
All India Radio broadcasts a variety of
programmes related to information, education
and entertainment. Special news bulletins are
also broadcast at specific occasions like session
of parliament and state legislatures.
Television (T.V.)
Television broadcasting has emerged as the
most effective audio-visual medium for
disseminating information and educating
masses. Initially, the T.V. services were limited
only to the National Capital where it began in
1959. After 1972, several other centres became
operational. In 1976, TV was delinked from All
India Radio (AIR) and got a separate identity
as Doordarshan (DD). After INSAT-IA (National
Television-DD1) became operational, Common
National Programmes (CNP) were started for the
entire network and its services were extended
to the backward and remote rural areas.
Satellite Communication
Satellites are mode of communication in
themselves as well as they regulate the use of other
means of communication. However, use of satellite
in getting a continuous and synoptic view of
larger area has made satellite communication very
vital for the country due to the economic and
strategic reasons. Satellite images can be used
for the weather forecast, monitoring of natural
calamities, surveillance of border areas, etc.
On the basis of configuration and purposes,
satellite system in India can be grouped into two:
Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) and
Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System (IRS). The
INSAT, which was established in 1983,is a multi-
purpose satellite system for telecommunication,
meteorological observation and for various other
data and programmes.
The IRS satellite system became
operational with the launching of IRS-IA in
March 1988 from Vaikanour in Russia. India
has also developed her own Launching Vehicle
PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle). These
satellites collect data in several spectral bands
and transmit them to the ground stations for
various uses. The National Remote Sensing
Centre (NRSC) at Hyderabad provides facilities
for acquisition of data and its processing. These
are very useful in the management of natural
resources.
